## Problems It Solves
1. **Complexity Overhead** - Professional video editors are overkill for simple tasks
2. **Web-based Limitations** - Browser-based editors have performance and file handling limitations
3. **Cross-platform Need** - Desktop app provides better performance and native file system access
4. **Quick Editing** - Need for rapid, simple video editing without learning curve

## How It Should Work
### User Experience Goals

- **No Learning Curve** - Self-explanatory interface for basic editing tasks

### Core User Journey
1. **Launch App** - Double-click to open native desktop application
2. **Import Video** - Drag MP4/MOV files or use file picker
3. **Preview Content** - See video in player, scrub through timeline
4. **Edit Clips** - Drag clips on timeline, set in/out points for trimming
5. **Export Result** - Generate final MP4 with edits applied

## Target Users
