## Architecture Refactoring Complete ✅

### Major Changes Implemented
- **Unified TimelineScreen**: Single component handles all video editing states
- **Eliminated Legacy Screens**: Removed VideoImportScreen and VideoPreviewScreen
- **Simplified Navigation**: Single 'editor' route with direct file picker → editor flow
- **Removed Drag & Drop**: Temporarily disabled for cleaner architecture
- **1-Click Workflow**: File selection automatically goes to timeline editor

### New Data Flow
```
User clicks "✂️ Editor" → TimelineScreen (no video) → ImportInterface
User clicks "Select Video File" → File selection → Automatic editor transition
TimelineScreen (with video) → TimelineEditorScreen (full editing)
```

### Benefits Achieved
- **Simplified UX**: 1-click file selection to editor
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed 2 entire screen directories
- **Better Performance**: No internal state management complexity
- **Consistent Flow**: Single path for all video editing

## Technical Implementation

### React 19 Best Practices
- **Component Composition**: Separate components for different concerns (EmptyEditorScreen vs TimelineEditorScreen)
- **Hook Consistency**: Same hooks called every render, no conditional hook calls
- **Performance**: Optimized re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- **Modern Patterns**: useEffectEvent for stable callbacks, proper cleanup

### Electron 39 Security
- **Context Isolation**: Enabled for security
- **Preload Scripts**: Secure IPC communication bridge
- **File Access**: Sandboxed with proper IPC handlers
- **Custom Protocol**: app:// for secure video file serving

### Konva.js 10 Performance
- **React-Konva**: Declarative canvas components
- **Automatic Batching**: React-Konva handles draw() optimization
- **Event Handling**: Proper drag constraints and real-time updates
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup on component unmount

## Active Decisions

### Unified Component System
- **Single Button Component**: Merged legacy + shadcn Button with Tailwind CSS
- **Card Replaces Container**: Modern Card component with variants
- **Unified Theme**: darkTheme.js consolidates all styling constants
- **Consistent Imports**: All components use shared/ui barrel exports

### Architecture Patterns
- **Screen Independence**: Each screen manages its own state and data flow
- **Shared Domains**: Common logic organized by domain (file, video, timeline)
- **Global State**: NavigationContext and SidebarContext for app-wide state
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

### Phase 6: CSS Grid Layout System ✅ COMPLETE (October 29, 2025)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Fixed header overflow and excessive whitespace
  - Header was `fixed` positioned causing content to overflow underneath
  - Timeline had `flex-1` expansion but canvas was only 120px tall
  - Hardcoded `h-15` and `mt-15` values created fragile layout
- **CSS Grid Implementation**: Elegant solution without hardcoded heights
  - ScreenLayout: `grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr]` for header/content split
  - TimelineEditorScreen: `grid grid-rows-[1fr_auto]` for video/timeline split
  - Timeline area: `grid grid-rows-[auto_auto_auto]` for natural heights
- **Header Refactoring**: Removed fixed positioning
  - Changed from `fixed top-0` to normal document flow
  - Removed hardcoded `h-15`, uses `py-md` for natural height
  - Removed `mt-15` margin compensation from MainContent
- **Timeline Optimization**: Natural height instead of expansion
  - Removed `flex-1` from TimelineCanvas wrapper
  - Canvas now centered with natural 120px height
  - No more excessive whitespace below ruler
  - Control panel sits directly below timeline
- **Benefits Achieved**:
  - Zero hardcoded pixel heights
  - Responsive to any screen size
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - No overflow issues
  - Minimal whitespace

### Phase 2: Dead File Removal ✅
- Removed 4 dead files (188 lines): TimelineScreenV2.jsx, App.jsx, useComponentVersion.js, duplicate useFileImport.js
- Fixed broken imports and verified functionality
- Zero breaking changes, application builds successfully

### Phase 3: Component Consolidation ✅
- Unified Button component with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui patterns
- Card component replaces Container functionality
- Merged theme systems into single darkTheme.js with legacy compatibility
- Updated all imports to use unified component system
- Verified Konva.js performance optimization (already optimal with React-Konva)

## Next Session Goals

2. Fix FFmpeg device enumeration error handling
3. Test native screen recording functionality
4. Integrate recorded videos with timeline system
5. Implement FFmpeg export functionality

## Recent Achievements

### Phase 12: Timeline Empty State Redesign + Dropped File Playback Fix ✅ COMPLETE (October 30, 2025)
- Implemented simplified Timeline empty state matching inspiration screenshot:
  - Keeps global header and left sidebar
  - Adds "Name your creation" header in content area
  - Centers existing `DragDropZone` for import (drag-and-drop + file picker)
- Added new `TimelineImportInterface` that wraps `DragDropZone` and forwards first imported file
- Updated `TimelineScreen` empty state to use `TimelineImportInterface`
- Fixed dropped file playback issue in `VideoElement`:
  - When a dropped file provides a `File` blob, create and use a `blob:` Object URL
  - Fallback to `app://` custom protocol for real file paths (picker/recordings)
  - Properly revokes object URLs to prevent leaks
- Result: Drag-and-drop to Timeline now renders and plays in `VideoPreview` correctly

### Phase 8: Architecture Refactoring ✅ COMPLETE (October 29, 2025)

- **Removed Drag & Drop**: Temporarily disabled for cleaner architecture
- **1-Click Workflow**: File selection automatically triggers editor transition
- **Auto-Callback**: useFileImport automatically calls onVideoImported on file selection
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed file selection confirmation UI and intermediate steps
- **Better Performance**: No internal state management, props-based rendering
