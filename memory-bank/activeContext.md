## What's Been Built ✅ COMPLETE

### Core Application
- **Electron App**: Native desktop application with React 19 frontend
- **Build System**: Vite + Electron Forge with optimized configuration
- **Native Packaging**: Successfully builds and packages for macOS
- **Security**: Context isolation, secure IPC, preload scripts

### Video Editing Features
- **Video Import**: File picker with MP4/MOV validation and error handling
- **Video Preview**: HTML5 video player with custom app:// protocol
- **Timeline Editor**: Konva.js canvas with draggable trim handles
- **Real-time Trimming**: Live preview of trim points with FFmpeg processing
- **State Persistence**: sessionStorage maintains video state across navigation

### Modern UI System
- **Dark Theme**: Unified theme system with purple accents (#6366f1)
- **Global Navigation**: Context-based routing with collapsible sidebar
- **Component Library**: Unified Button, Card, ErrorMessage, VideoElement components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with shadcn/ui patterns
- **Responsive Layout**: Consistent Sidebar + Header across all screens

### Architecture & Code Quality
- **Domain-Driven Structure**: Organized shared domains (file, video, timeline, export)
- **React 19 Patterns**: Component composition, modern hooks, optimized rendering
- **Clean Codebase**: 376 lines removed through refactoring, zero breaking changes
- **Production Ready**: No debug logging, comprehensive error handling

## Current Focus
**Next Phase**: Export Functionality Implementation
- Add FFmpeg export to create final trimmed video
- Implement export UI with progress indication
- Test complete workflow from import to export
- Package as distributable macOS app

## Technical Implementation

### React 19 Best Practices
- **Component Composition**: Separate components for different concerns (EmptyEditorScreen vs TimelineEditorScreen)
- **Hook Consistency**: Same hooks called every render, no conditional hook calls
- **Performance**: Optimized re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- **Modern Patterns**: useEffectEvent for stable callbacks, proper cleanup

### Electron 39 Security
- **Context Isolation**: Enabled for security
- **Preload Scripts**: Secure IPC communication bridge
- **File Access**: Sandboxed with proper IPC handlers
- **Custom Protocol**: app:// for secure video file serving

### Konva.js 10 Performance
- **React-Konva**: Declarative canvas components
- **Automatic Batching**: React-Konva handles draw() optimization
- **Event Handling**: Proper drag constraints and real-time updates
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup on component unmount

## Active Decisions

### Unified Component System
- **Single Button Component**: Merged legacy + shadcn Button with Tailwind CSS
- **Card Replaces Container**: Modern Card component with variants
- **Unified Theme**: darkTheme.js consolidates all styling constants
- **Consistent Imports**: All components use shared/ui barrel exports

### Architecture Patterns
- **Screen Independence**: Each screen manages its own state and data flow
- **Shared Domains**: Common logic organized by domain (file, video, timeline)
- **Global State**: NavigationContext and SidebarContext for app-wide state
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

## Recent Achievements

### Phase 6: CSS Grid Layout System ✅ COMPLETE (October 29, 2025)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Fixed header overflow and excessive whitespace
  - Header was `fixed` positioned causing content to overflow underneath
  - Timeline had `flex-1` expansion but canvas was only 120px tall
  - Hardcoded `h-15` and `mt-15` values created fragile layout
- **CSS Grid Implementation**: Elegant solution without hardcoded heights
  - ScreenLayout: `grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr]` for header/content split
  - TimelineEditorScreen: `grid grid-rows-[1fr_auto]` for video/timeline split
  - Timeline area: `grid grid-rows-[auto_auto_auto]` for natural heights
- **Header Refactoring**: Removed fixed positioning
  - Changed from `fixed top-0` to normal document flow
  - Removed hardcoded `h-15`, uses `py-md` for natural height
  - Removed `mt-15` margin compensation from MainContent
- **Timeline Optimization**: Natural height instead of expansion
  - Removed `flex-1` from TimelineCanvas wrapper
  - Canvas now centered with natural 120px height
  - No more excessive whitespace below ruler
  - Control panel sits directly below timeline
- **Benefits Achieved**:
  - Zero hardcoded pixel heights
  - Responsive to any screen size
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - No overflow issues
  - Minimal whitespace

### Phase 2: Dead File Removal ✅
- Removed 4 dead files (188 lines): TimelineScreenV2.jsx, App.jsx, useComponentVersion.js, duplicate useFileImport.js
- Fixed broken imports and verified functionality
- Zero breaking changes, application builds successfully

### Phase 3: Component Consolidation ✅
- Unified Button component with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui patterns
- Card component replaces Container functionality
- Merged theme systems into single darkTheme.js with legacy compatibility
- Updated all imports to use unified component system
- Verified Konva.js performance optimization (already optimal with React-Konva)

## Next Session Goals
1. Implement FFmpeg export functionality
2. Add export progress indication
3. Test complete workflow from import to export
4. Package and test distributable app
5. Complete MVP sprint

## Blockers
- None - all core functionality working and ready for export implementation
